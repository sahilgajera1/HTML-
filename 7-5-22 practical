       <span><p>The Somnath temple, also called SomanƒÅtha temple or Deo Patan, is a Hindu temple located in Prabhas Patan,
            Veraval in Gujarat, India. It is one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus and is believed to be 
            first among the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva.[1] The temple was reconstructed several times in the 
            past after repeated destruction by multiple Muslim invaders and rulers.[2][3][4][5] It is unclear when the 
            first version of the Somnath temple was built with estimates varying between the early centuries of the 
            1st-millennium to about the 9th-century CE.[6][7] The temple's history is a subject of unresolved disputes 
            among historians.[8][9]</p></span>
